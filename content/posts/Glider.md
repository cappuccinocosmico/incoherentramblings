Design Process
Printout of your Aery design.
Hand drawings of your design with dimension measurements.
Descriptions of how you modified your design during the build process (did you sand the wood to make an airfoil? What thickness of wood did you use? Etc.)
Flight observations: How did your plane perform?  Be detailed and use proper verbage.
How did you further modify your plane? (realigned the vertical stabilizer, sanded the right wing to balance, etc.) Was the glider as stable as you expected? Why or why not might this be so?  What techniques did you use to “trim” the glider for straight and gently descending flight?   How many test flights were required to get the glider trimmed for long distance, straight-line flight? Was this expected? Why or why not?Be detailed on what you did and the desired outcome.
How did it fly after modifications?  More observations.
Repeat steps 4-6 as many times as needed.
Explanations for how you went about making it fly – Be specific – Summarize concepts of glider stability and how the modification will address the issue (Center of gravity, center of lift, pitch, yaw, roll, lateral stability)  I am going to change __________ because _______________.  Did you think about difficulties in construction?
A picture of your finished glider:  Printed and placed in your notebook along with one submitted digitally.
Final distance flown. Observations about your competition flights.

Reflection Questions
If your grade were solely dependent on the distance flown, how would you change your design?
After discussing the results (Aery flight number vs. distance) what conclusions can you make about the software?  Is it accurate?  Is you building ability more important than the design?
After the competition, what did you notice about the different designs and results?  Did bigger gliders go farther? Did smaller?  Did traditional designs perform better than experimental?
