# Rrit of Certiorari
> A type of writ, meant for rare use, by which an appellate court decides to review a case at its discretion.  The word certiorari comes from Law Latin and means "to be more fully informed."  A writ of certiorari orders a lower court to deliver its record in a case so that the higher court may review it.  The U.S. Supreme Court uses certiorari to select most of the cases it hears. The writ of certiorari is a common law writ, which may be abrogated or controlled entirely by statute or court rules.

This is a very important concept in our case, as its one of the legal actions filed by DOJ to try to delay the lawsuit, witch at the current point in time they have sucessfuly done.

# Public Trust Doctrine
> The principle that certain natural and cultural resources are preserved for public use, and that the government owns and must protect and maintain these resources for the public's use. For example, under this doctrine, the government holds title to all submerged land under navigable waters. Thus, any use or sale of such land must be in the public interest.

This is probably the most important legal vocabulary, because it defines the most important legal prong of the lawsuit
