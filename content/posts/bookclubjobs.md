### Questions
1. The Predatory Nature of War

In The Yellow Birds, war is repeatedly characterized as a living, breathing being that hunts those involved within it. The first notable personification of war occurs on page 3: “While we slept, the war rubbed its thousand ribs against the ground in prayer. When we pressed onward through exhaustion, its eyes were white and open in the dark. While we ate, the war fasted, fed by its own deprivation. It made love and gave birth and spread through fire.” This quote describes war as ritualistic, savage, and sinister. Kevin Powers manages to convey the enormous toll that war can take on an individual. In fact in this passage war takes on a rather negative vibe, as if the book is condoning the war that took place in iraq. (although I havent noticed them talking about all the geopolitical factors that lead to the iraq war.)
2. Loss of Innocence

One of the most prevalent themes of the novel is loss of innocence. We see this theme most clearly in Daniel Murphy's character. Murph is an eighteen-year-old soldier who quickly becomes John Bartle's best friend. At the beginning of the novel, Powers characterizes Murph as a young, innocent teenager that is always optimistic. However, throughout the novel, we gradually see Murph lose his morale and start to hold the same pessimistic views as Bartle. In addition, Murph’s appearance deteriorates as the war goes on, offering a physical representation of his gradual loss of innocence. Initially, Murph is described as having blond hair and blue eyes, but with time, his eyes fall farther into his sockets. This is emphasized in the hypothesis that war fundamentaly dehumanising the pepole who practice it.
<!-- The Perseverance of Soldiers

The perseverance of soldiers is a theme strongly emphasized in The Yellow Birds. It is a necessity in order to survive the war. On page 116, Powers demonstrates this theme in John Bartle's narration of a military operation: "I kept going. I kept going because Murph kept going and Sterling and the LT kept going and the other squads would keep going and I was terrified that I would be the one who did not." The polysyndeton in this quote (repetition of "and") creates an atmosphere of suspense and danger, suggesting that unity and determination in these soldiers is something inspired out of fear rather than confidence. From this passage, we can also assume that this feeling of fear is not something unique to John Bartlele, but is instead the fuel for every soldier's conformity and obedience. -->


### Passages


    "I remember feeling relief in basic while everyone else was frantic with fear. It had dawned on me that I'd never have to make a decision again. That seemed freeing, but it gnawed at some part of me even then. Eventually, I had to learn that freedom is not the same thing as the absence of accountability."
    -Bartle, chapter 2

The Bartle recalls the naivety of his thoughts before going to war. The knowledge of not having to be responsible for anything seemed relieving. It is something that a young person, with not much experience, not knowing what he's getting into, would think.
Freedom Too VS Freedom From
I probably nailed it on the head with this.


    "It’s lovely to think that snow can be special. We’re always told it is. Of all those million million flakes that fall, no two are alike, forever and ever, amen. I’ve spent some time looking out the window of my cabin watching snowflakes fall like a shot dove’s feathers fluttering slowly down to the ground. They all look the same to me."
    -Bartle , chapter 2

This shows the pessimism of a soldier that has been in the war, has seen the horrors of it.
Young soldiers die, people are nothing but a number, and when they die they are all the same, Corpses are indistinguishable

Connects to falling snowflakes.
Destruction of innocence

    "I wanted to go to sleep and stay there, that’s all. A passive wish, one I didn’t push. Sure, there is a fine line between not wanting to wake up and actually wanting to kill yourself, and while I discovered you can walk that line for a long while without even noticing, anybody who is around you surely will, and then of course all kinds of unanswerable questions will not be far behind."
    -narrator (Bartle), chapter 7

If there is a fine line then that means that there is not much difference, if the line is fine then that line could easily be broken and from this it can clearly be seen that Bartle was close to suicide even though he seems to deny it. Sure you can walk the line for a long while but you are bound to fall from it at some point.


    "I thought of my grandfather’s war. How they had destinations and purpose. How the next day we’d march out under a sun hanging low over the plains in the east. We’d go back into a city that had fought this battle yearly; a slow, bloody parade in fall to mark the change of season. We’d drive them out. We always had. We’d kill them. They’d shoot us and blow off our limbs and run into the hills and wadis, back into the alleys and dusty villages. Then they’d come back, and we’d start over by waving to them as they leaned against lampposts and unfurled green awnings while drinking tea in front of their shops. While we patrolled the streets, we’d throw candy to their children with whom we’d fight in the fall a few more years from now."
    -narrator (Bartle), chapter 4

Bartle realizes the pointlessness of war while walking into the city Al Tafar and seeing all the decay. How their only purpose is to kill each other while not so long ago they walked among each other. It is a ridiculous and hypocritical cycle of cruelty.
Characters
John Bartle
The main character and the narrator of the novel he was thrown into war really young. He joined the army because he wanted to become a man. He was bullied in school because he liked to read, liked poetry. To Bartle war is pointless. It leaves young men physically and mentally crippled. He feels that he doesn't deserve the gratitude he is receiving upon returning from war, so he becomes isolated, haunted by what happened in Iraq and by the death of his companion Murph. He feels guilty for not keeping the promise he made to Murph's mother-that he will bring her son back. At the end he lets the memory of Murph go but the fact that he ends up living isolated in a cabin by the mountains tells us that the memory of war will never leave him.

Daniel Murphy
Daniel Murphy, a soldier only eighteen years old, is Bartle's companion that dies in Iraq. He is described as clumsy, small in frame and often smiling. Opposite to Bartle, who was able to survive through the atrocities of war, Murph couldn't handle what was happening in Iraq. After the only hope, the only compassion in the form of the female medic, that kept him somewhat sane and therefore alive was gone, he was then completely lost.

<!-- I really hope I'm not treading on toes starting these... please tell me if you'd rather I waited. I am enjoying your questions and observations, Casceil, and want to hear more... am just finding myself racing ahead and wanting to get my thoughts down while fresh...

I find it interesting how poetic and disconnected this chapter is considering it's his homecoming. It's like the sections about the removed-from-reality war are the most real and solid, and the closer we get back to 'reality', the more dreamlike and unreal things become for him, which for me brings home brilliantly and subtly something about the experience of war that many accounts say more bluntly.

The conversation with the barman is also outstanding. It comes through to me very clearly that this will be a pattern for Bartle; people thinking they understand something about him, or that showing their appreciation will be appreciated, when it's the last thing he wants. It underlines the gulf between where he's arrived at and where he once was (and most everyone else still is). I think he also feels that accepting the man's offer would implicitly show support for his views on the people of Iraq. What makes it so fraught is you can absolutely see that there's zero point in Bartle trying to make him understand any of this; he's caught between not being able to fall in with it and not being able to push back.

The imagery of him disappearing as he removes his uniform is also very powerful.

Chapter 5 and 6 are all about the PTSD the soldiers are now showing. In chapter 5 Bartle is in an airport where he begins hallucinating about leaving a trail of sand behind him and refuses to let the airport bartender show any gratitude to Bartle defending our country. Chapter 6 tells that the war is getting more intense and its taking a toll on all of the soldier's mental stability.  -->
