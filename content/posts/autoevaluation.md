What language do I use?
I think that I am pretty good at trying to communicate an idea using my known vocabulary, searching for synonyms and other things. Although I still struggle a lot with verb conjugation. Proficient


How do I use the language?
I can use the language pretty well, even though when i am forced to use it in practice it is hard to keep pace understanding what is being said. But that's kind of to be expected after only a year of spanish. Proficient.



How well am I understood?

This is currently my biggest weakness, I have a significant amount of trouble conjugating and changing words, the rules seem quite difficult, and it gets in the way of me saying things effectively. Some of the accents that change the pronunciation of words tend to also be quite difficult Partially Proficient.

How well do I understand?

I am pretty good at picking out meaning from a sentence already written, it is significantly easier to tease out the meaning in a sentence then to make a sentence meaning to communicate a intent. This has always been hard for me, even in english. But I can remember a lot of the meanings, and have gotten pretty good at figuring out the rest through context. Advanced

How well am I understood? Is currently really hard for me to do and I must improve it.

Describe, in a short paragraph (English or Spanish), what two strategies you will use to help you improve and why. (These could include study practices used or suggestions given during a Charlar activity as well as anything you have come with on your own.)

I think that the exercises where you have to write a sentence to describe the action/activity exercises have and continue to be really helpful for me. In addition the final exams that have more project like things in them like for instance In adition to that, the write your own story extercises, while quite hard for me are realy helpful.
