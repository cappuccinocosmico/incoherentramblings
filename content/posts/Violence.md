In the short story *Bullet in the Brain*, Tobias Wolff writes a story that deals with both emotional and physical violence.


Bullet in the brain by *Tobias Wolff* is saying that the fundamental cause of violence is primarily a psycological phenomona, mostly relating to the emotion of shame, this paralells ander's journy through the second part of the story. Where after he is shot in the head, all of his regrettable life experiences sail past him forgotten in favor of one experience where he acted like a decent human being. "*This is what he remembered...He wants to hear Coyle’s cousin repeat what he’s just said, but he knows better than to ask.  The others will think he’s being a jerk, ragging the kid for his grammar.*"
