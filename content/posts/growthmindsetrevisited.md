# How am I doing academically?
I am doing very poorly acidemicly in this class at the moment. However I think that there is definintly room for improvement. I have been lagging behind the whole semester, where there are days where I will just not work on spanish and focus on my other classes like aerospace engineering and multivariable calculus. And totaly neglect spanish, one of my most important classes. I have also been having a lot of trouble conceptualy, getting arround too and understanding the concepts, that in turn makes it less engaging, and then I understand the concepts even less well.
# What are some habits I need to improve (or continue doing)?
Probably the most important concept is to spend time engaging with the lecture materials, and the practice activities. And to also stop working on spanish with this burst mentality. A big reason that I have a lot of difficulty conceptualy is that I dont give it time to marinate in my brain properly, I need to treat this class as I would one of my main school classes. That is I need to focus on it daily. Probably about 2 hours a day. And I need to do work on it outside the classroom, and
# How will I make changes to improve?
I will focus mostly on trying to be consistent about turning stuff in, although my preformance might improve when I am in oregon. But they key thing is to remain as consistent as possible.
