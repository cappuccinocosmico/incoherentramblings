#### In the short story *"Where are you going where have you been"* by Joyce Carol Oates shows us a family where lack of communication and the unacceptance of another person, this prossess eventualy causes a cold and unhealthy dynamic between Connie and the rest of her family.

<!-- Connie: Neglect

> There was one good thing: June went places with girl friends of hers, girls who were just as plain and steady as she, and so when
Connie wanted to do that her mother had no objections.*

> *Her parents and sister were going to a barbecue at an aunt's house and Connie said no, she wasn't interested, rolling her
eyes to let her mother know just what she thought of it. "Stay home alone then," her mother said sharply. Connie sat out back in a lawn chair and watched them drive away* -->

The story starts off with describing the family situation of the main character Connie, is describing the relationship with her mother and her mothers sisters specificly how unnaccepting they are of connie bu constantly comparing her to her sister.
"Connie had to hear her praised all the time by her mother and her mother's sisters. June did this, June did that, she saved money and helped clean the house and cooked and Connie couldn't do a thing, her mind was all filled with trashy daydreams" *Oates 1*.
In this one quote it shows how abuse and unnacceptance have damanged the family dynamic. It damages Connie, by comparing her to her sister, they are causing an unhealthy family dynamic But this isnt all, there are a lot of instances of neglect and abandonment by the father who "
Their father was away at work most of the time and when
he came home he wanted supper and he read the newspaper at supper and after supper he went to bed. He didn't bother talking much to them," *Oates 1*
All of this familial abuse eventualy comes back to cause severe problems. After a long conversation where Arnald Friend has terrified Connie into her house, and is using her poor family dynamic to convice her to go with him.
"The place where you came from ain't there any more, and
where you had in mind to go is cancelled out. This place you are now—inside your daddy's house—is nothing but a cardboard box I
can knock down any time." *Oates 9* This shows the ultimate consequence of a poor family dynamic. As it leads to arnald's ultimate sucess. As he sucessfuly leads Connie away from her family and to her death/rape/kidnaping. The story asks us to consider how this scene would have played out differently if connie had had a better family situation, and in doing so it shows us the consequences of a family gone wrong.

<!--
The story so far describes the family dramas of Connie, it shows that her family often *compares her unfavorably to her sister*, and are noticably distant. Once she declines her family obligations on a barbaque. *A car shows up then she has a peculiar conversation with a mysterious character called Arnald Friend.* He talks in riddles and seems to be hiding a secret, and

>*Her sister June was twenty-four and still lived at home. She was a secretary in the high school Connie attended, and if that wasn't bad enough—with her in the same building—she was so plain and chunky and steady that Connie had to hear her praised all the time by her mother and her mother's sisters. June did this, June did that, she saved money and helped clean the house and cooked and Connie couldn't do a thing, her mind was all filled with trashy daydreams*


>*There was one good thing: June went places with girl friends of hers, girls who were just as plain and steady as she, and so when Connie wanted to do that her mother had no objections. The father of Connie's best girl friend drove the girls the three miles to town and left them at a shopping plaza so they could walk through the stores or go to a movie, and when he came to pick them up again at eleven he never bothered to ask what they had done*




>*. It's nice and shining and all for me. I thank you sweetheart," he said with a mock bow, but again he almost lost his balance. He had to bend and adjust his boots. Evidently his feet did not go all the way down; the boots must have been stuffed with something so that he would seem taller.*
