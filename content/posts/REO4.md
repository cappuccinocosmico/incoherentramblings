As shown in the photo above I am a member of the climate change lawsuit featuring noted Climate Scientist Jim Hansen, as a plantiff.

This document that I am reading today I have read multiple times, it is one of the most important documents for the case, it is a decision writen by judge Ann Akien, about a year or so into the filing of this lawsuit. So I thought I should explain some context.
