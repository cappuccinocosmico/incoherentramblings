As shown in the photo above I am a member of the climate change lawsuit featuring noted Climate Scientist Jim Hansen, as a plantiff.

This document that I am reading today I have read multiple times, it is one of the most important documents for the case, it is a decision writen by judge Ann Akien, about a year or so into the filing of this lawsuit. So I thought I should explain some context. This lawsuit was filed almost exactly three years ago, as an early freshman I was convinced that it wouldnt blossom into the most important climate change lawsuit going on in america. I was thinking that it would serve as a potential faliure that would inspire future lawsuits, and it has been a wonderful experience to watch it being proven wrong. So far we have had essentialy all positive rulings. This one essentialy catapulting the case from obscurity, with a ruling that affirms all of the points we have made so far in the case. Trial starts in 2 weeks, I am probably going to testify in court about the harms climate change has caused me.

When I read this about 2 years ago when it was first announced. I didnt understand it at all, however when i reread it I am starting to truely understand what makes the case that I am on fundamentaly different from other lawsuits of its type,
