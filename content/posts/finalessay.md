A big part of how violence ecscalates is the need for revenge against fallen comrades. A certain example of this is when we see bartle come across a fallen soldier, he remarks"The man had been made an unwilling weapon. They’d captured and killed him and eviscerated him and stuffed his abdominal cavity with explosives, detonated him when they were sure we had recognized him, then attacked." This shows the cycl  e of violence at work, when the enemy captures the fallen soldier they take revenge on him in a very meaningful way,

The primary theme in the novel is the innescapable cycle of violence, specificly how commiting violence aclimatises your mind to even more violence. This example is particulary pertinant, when bartle is reflecting on the war after retreating from his freinds and family, he remarks "Nothing seemed more natural than someone getting killed. And now, as I reflect on how I felt and behaved as a boy of twenty-one from my position of safety in a warm cabin above a clear stream in the Blue Ridge, I can only tell myself that it was necessary." This shows an example of how after seeing so much bloodshead in the Iraq War he seems accustomed almost calm about the notion of death and murder, this in turn makes doing those seem less horrible. Another example from the book comes when Murph and Bartle are in a battle, watching the mortars rain arround them they notice a little girl, no older then 5 or 6 git hit with one. But however Murph reacts like this. "Holy shit, that bitch got murdered,” Murph said. There was no grief, or anguish, or joy, or pity in that statement. There was no judgment made. He was just surprised, like he was waking from a long afternoon nap, disoriented,"

Vicious Cycle

Preservation of Mind
The most common example in *The Yellow Birds* for how violence begets more violence is the mind's tendancy to snap under pressure, especialy when dealing with the horrors of war. We see emotional damage to the main protagonist when he is traveling to the airport to pick up his mother, when he starts hallucinating about the horrors of war, bartle remarks on these hallucinations as he goes through the airport: "The ghosts of the dead filled the empty seats of every gate I passed: boys destroyed by mortars and rockets and bullets and IEDs to the point that when we tried to get them to a medevac, the skin slid off, or limbs barely held in place detached." (Powers 104) This shows that the commiters of violence often have to deal with the traumatic memories of there acts. In this scene we see his mind snap under the pressure of the things that he had witnessed during the war, specificly all the death and brutality that acompenies it. We see that in this situation he isolates himself from society and even becomes violent when he beats up a bartender. The next big example of this occors twards the end of the novel when Sterling and Bartle learn of Murph's death. They dont want to bring his body home so they dump it in a river. And not wanting the word to get out about his death this happens."He floated off quickly in the steady current, and in the water past the bulrushes little pools formed where his eyes had been. “Like it never happened, Bartle. That’s the only way,” Sterling said. “Yeah, I know.” I looked at the ground. The dust blowing in fine swirls around my boots. I knew what was coming. Sterling shot the cartwright once, in the face, and he crumpled to the ground."(Powers 212) This shows that in trying to avoid trauma about the horrors of war, we see them murder an innocent iraqi, (in turn causing more trauma for the family of the victim), it shows that in the process of trying to preserve ther mind, and the minds of others. They murder a innocent man to try to make Murph's mother feel better. All of these combined show that a way to deal with the horrors of war is for ones self to commit violence, and in turn those violent acts in turn cause trauma to other pepole, causing the cycle of violence to continue.

I’d known that snow comes early in the year in the mountains where Daniel was from, November, sure, and sometimes as early as October. But I only found out later that she’d read that letter with snow falling all around her. That she’d set it on the seat next to her while she mushed her old right-hand-drive Jeep up and down the switchbacks on her route, carving clean tracks through the white erasure that had fallen all throughout the night before. And that as she pulled down the long gravel path leading to their little house, on the winter-dormant apple orchard Daniel had talked about so often, she kept sneaking glances at the return address.

Need For Violence and Control

Violence in *The Yellow Birds* also comes from a psycological need for control


> But I knew. I shot him and he slumped over behind the wall. He was shot again by someone else an>>d the bullet went through his chest and ricocheted, breaking a potted plant hanging from a window above the courtyard. Then he was shot again and he fell at a strange angle—backward over his bent legs—and most of the side of his face was gone and there was a lot of blood and it pooled around him in the dust.

She tried dragging the body, and her face contorted with effort as she pulled the old woman by her one complete arm. The girl described circles into the fine dust as she paced around the body. The path they made was marked in blood: from the car smoking and ablaze, through a courtyard ringed by hyacinths, to the place where the woman lay dead, attended by the small child, who rocked and moved her lips, perhaps singing some desert elegy that I couldn’t hear.

In the novel Bartle comes to understand how the cycle of violence perpetuates itself. This is most clearly demonstrated in the fact that Bart both witnesses the oposing side commiting violence and him doing the same. But then after the war had ended, we see the reasons



John Irving’s main character Garp was ignorant to the problems that come
with misunderstanding the difference and relationship between love and lust; and this
almost lead to his relationship crashing against the shore and disintegrating. Ever
since a young age, Jenny Fields had warned him about lust, but Garp and many of
the other characters saw it as “a man’s problem,” which lead to his inability to
balance love and lust and severe problems in both his marriage and family. inability
to balance love and lust and severe problems in both his marriage and family. From
Garp’s encounter’s with Cushie, Alice, and the baby sitter, John Irving is
clearly expressing how lust is more about physical gratification and the
selfish desires of the individual. Whereas, the enduring relationship that he
and Helen have, shows how love requires patience, kindness, and the ability
to put one’s own needs second to the other individual. Even though these
emotions seem to be contradictory or working against each other, the reader
also sees through Garp and Helen’s marriage that both emotions need to be
present in order for it to be successful. The novel The World According to
Garp, by John Irving, is a controversial novel that deals with the complex
relationship of love and lust; one is a kind, caring, and selfless emotion, yet
the other immediate, selfish and egocentric, yet they both need to be
present and work together.
<!-- The story starts off with describing the family situation of the main character Connie, is describing the relationship with her mother and her mothers sisters specificly how unnaccepting they are of connie bu constantly comparing her to her sister.
"Connie had to hear her praised all the time by her mother and her mother's sisters. June did this, June did that, she saved money and helped clean the house and cooked and Connie couldn't do a thing, her mind was all filled with trashy daydreams" *Oates 1*.
In this one quote it shows how abuse and unnacceptance have damanged the family dynamic. It damages Connie, by comparing her to her sister, they are causing an unhealthy family dynamic But this isnt all, there are a lot of instances of neglect and abandonment by the father who "
Their father was away at work most of the time and when
he came home he wanted supper and he read the newspaper at supper and after supper he went to bed. He didn't bother talking much to them," *Oates 1*
All of this familial abuse eventualy comes back to cause severe problems. After a long conversation where Arnald Friend has terrified Connie into her house, and is using her poor family dynamic to convice her to go with him.
"The place where you came from ain't there any more, and
where you had in mind to go is cancelled out. This place you are now—inside your daddy's house—is nothing but a cardboard box I
can knock down any time." *Oates 9* This shows the ultimate consequence of a poor family dynamic. As it leads to arnald's ultimate sucess. As he sucessfuly leads Connie away from her family and to her death/rape/kidnaping. The story asks us to consider how this scene would have played out differently if connie had had a better family situation, and in doing so it shows us the consequences of a family gone wrong. -->

The war had killed thousands by September. Their bodies lined the pocked avenues at irregular intervals. They were hidden in alleys, were found in bloating piles in the troughs of the hills outside the cities, the faces puffed and green, allergic now to life. The war had tried its best to kill us all: man, woman, child. But it had killed fewer than a thousand soldiers like me and Murph. Those numbers still meant something to us as what passed for fall began. Murph and I had agreed. We didn’t want to be the thousandth killed. If we died later, then we died. But let that number be someone else’s milestone.

Nothing seemed more natural than someone getting killed. And now, as I reflect on how I felt and behaved as a boy of twenty-one from my position of safety in a warm cabin above a clear stream in the Blue Ridge, I can only tell myself that it was necessary.

I know it isn’t like that now. There were no bullets with my name on them, or with Murph’s, for that matter. There were no bombs made just for us. Any of them would have killed us just as well as they’d killed the owners of those names. We didn’t have a time laid out for us, or a place.

I try so hard now to remember if I saw any hint of what was coming, if there was some shadow over him, some way I could have known he was so close to being killed. In my memory of those days on the rooftop, he is half a ghost. But I didn’t see it then, and couldn’t. No one can see that. I guess I’m glad I didn’t know, because we were happy that morning in Al Tafar, in September. Our relief was coming. The day was full of light and warm. We slept.

# In the book *The Yellow Birds* by Kevin Powers, violence is described as a vicious cycle, caused by the need to preserve ones mind against the horrors of war, as well as the need for dominance and control





# Physical Violence
### Comes from disrespect
### Comes from shame
### Used to assert power or pride

# Emotional Violence
### Does not give importance or respect to others feelings

### Refusal to listen to
### Denying a person’s feelings
### Telling people how to feel
### Ridiculing
### Controlling behavior
### Asserting Dominance
### Makes people feel powerless or angry
