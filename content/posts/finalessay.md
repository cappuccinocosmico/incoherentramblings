# In the book *The Yellow Birds* by Kevin Powers, violence is described as a vicious cycle, caused by the need to preserve ones mind against the horrors of war, as well as the need for dominance and control.



Vicious Cycle

Preservation of Mind
The most common example in *The Yellow Birds*for how violence begets more violence is the mind's tendancy to snap under pressure, especialy when dealing with the horrors of war. We see emotional damage to the main protagonist when he is traveling to the airport to pick up his mother, when he starts hallucinating about the horrors of war. "The ghosts of the dead filled the empty seats of every gate I passed: boys destroyed by mortars and rockets and bullets and IEDs to the point that when we tried to get them to a medevac, the skin slid off, or limbs barely held in place detached." (Powers 104) This shows that the commiters of violence often have to deal with the traumatic memories of there acts. In this scene we see his mind snap under the pressure of the things that he had witnessed during the war, specificly all the death and brutality that acompenies it. We see that in this situation he isolates himself from society and even becomes violent when he beats up a bartender. The next big example of this occors twards the end of the novel when Sterling and Bartle learn of Murph's death. They dont want to bring his body home so they dump it in a river. And not wanting the word to get out about his death this happens."He floated off quickly in the steady current, and in the water past the bulrushes little pools formed where his eyes had been. “Like it never happened, Bartle. That’s the only way,” Sterling said. “Yeah, I know.” I looked at the ground. The dust blowing in fine swirls around my boots. I knew what was coming. Sterling shot the cartwright once, in the face, and he crumpled to the ground."(Powers 212) This shows that in trying to avoid trauma about the horrors of war, we see them murder an innocent iraqi, (in turn causing more trauma for the family of the victim), it shows that in the process of trying to preserve ther mind, and the minds of others. They murder a innocent man to try to make Murph's mother feel better. All of these combined show that a way to deal with the horrors of war is for ones self to commit violence, and in turn those violent acts in turn cause trauma to other pepole, causing the cycle of violence to continue.

Need For Violence and Controll

<!-- The story starts off with describing the family situation of the main character Connie, is describing the relationship with her mother and her mothers sisters specificly how unnaccepting they are of connie bu constantly comparing her to her sister.
"Connie had to hear her praised all the time by her mother and her mother's sisters. June did this, June did that, she saved money and helped clean the house and cooked and Connie couldn't do a thing, her mind was all filled with trashy daydreams" *Oates 1*.
In this one quote it shows how abuse and unnacceptance have damanged the family dynamic. It damages Connie, by comparing her to her sister, they are causing an unhealthy family dynamic But this isnt all, there are a lot of instances of neglect and abandonment by the father who "
Their father was away at work most of the time and when
he came home he wanted supper and he read the newspaper at supper and after supper he went to bed. He didn't bother talking much to them," *Oates 1*
All of this familial abuse eventualy comes back to cause severe problems. After a long conversation where Arnald Friend has terrified Connie into her house, and is using her poor family dynamic to convice her to go with him.
"The place where you came from ain't there any more, and
where you had in mind to go is cancelled out. This place you are now—inside your daddy's house—is nothing but a cardboard box I
can knock down any time." *Oates 9* This shows the ultimate consequence of a poor family dynamic. As it leads to arnald's ultimate sucess. As he sucessfuly leads Connie away from her family and to her death/rape/kidnaping. The story asks us to consider how this scene would have played out differently if connie had had a better family situation, and in doing so it shows us the consequences of a family gone wrong. -->

The war had killed thousands by September. Their bodies lined the pocked avenues at irregular intervals. They were hidden in alleys, were found in bloating piles in the troughs of the hills outside the cities, the faces puffed and green, allergic now to life. The war had tried its best to kill us all: man, woman, child. But it had killed fewer than a thousand soldiers like me and Murph. Those numbers still meant something to us as what passed for fall began. Murph and I had agreed. We didn’t want to be the thousandth killed. If we died later, then we died. But let that number be someone else’s milestone.

Nothing seemed more natural than someone getting killed. And now, as I reflect on how I felt and behaved as a boy of twenty-one from my position of safety in a warm cabin above a clear stream in the Blue Ridge, I can only tell myself that it was necessary.

I know it isn’t like that now. There were no bullets with my name on them, or with Murph’s, for that matter. There were no bombs made just for us. Any of them would have killed us just as well as they’d killed the owners of those names. We didn’t have a time laid out for us, or a place.

But I knew. I shot him and he slumped over behind the wall. He was shot again by someone else and the bullet went through his chest and ricocheted, breaking a potted plant hanging from a window above the courtyard. Then he was shot again and he fell at a strange angle—backward over his bent legs—and most of the side of his face was gone and there was a lot of blood and it pooled around him in the dust.

“Holy shit, that bitch got murdered,” Murph said. There was

no grief, or anguish, or joy, or pity in that statement. There was no judgment made. He was just surprised, like he was waking from a long afternoon nap, disoriented,

The girl ducked behind the building, then emerged again, this time shuffling toward the old woman very slowly. She tried dragging the body, and her face contorted with effort as she pulled the old woman by her one complete arm. The girl described circles into the fine dust as she paced around the body. The path they made was marked in blood: from the car smoking and ablaze, through a courtyard ringed by hyacinths, to the place where the woman lay dead, attended by the small child, who rocked and moved her lips, perhaps singing some desert elegy that I couldn’t hear.

I try so hard now to remember if I saw any hint of what was coming, if there was some shadow over him, some way I could have known he was so close to being killed. In my memory of those days on the rooftop, he is half a ghost. But I didn’t see it then, and couldn’t. No one can see that. I guess I’m glad I didn’t know, because we were happy that morning in Al Tafar, in September. Our relief was coming. The day was full of light and warm. We slept.

caused me to pick up a pencil and write a letter to a dead boy’s mother, to write it in his name, having known him plenty long enough to know it was not his way to call his mother “Mom.” I’d known a lot, really. I’d known that snow comes early in the year in the mountains where Daniel was from, November, sure, and sometimes as early as October. But I only found out later that she’d read that letter with snow falling all around her. That she’d set it on the seat next to her while she mushed her old right-hand-drive Jeep up and down the switchbacks on her route, carving clean tracks through the white erasure that had fallen all throughout the night before. And that as she pulled down the long gravel path leading to their little house, on the winter-dormant apple orchard Daniel had talked about so often, she kept sneaking glances at the return address. She

The ghosts of the dead filled the empty seats of every gate I passed: boys destroyed by mortars and rockets and bullets and IEDs to the point that when we tried to get them to a medevac, the skin slid off, or limbs barely held in place detached, and I thought that they were young and had girls at home or some dream that they thought would make their lives important. They had been wrong of course. You don’t dream when you are dead. I dream. The living dream, though I won’t say thanks for that.

We walked the body in the cart down to the edge of the river. The hermit walked around to the rear of his cart, stroked the mule’s flank and then embraced Murph, lifting him out of the flat carriage. Sterling and I each grabbed a leg and we walked the last few steps to the river and laid him in. He floated off quickly in the steady current, and in the water past the bulrushes little pools formed where his eyes had been. “Like it never happened, Bartle. That’s the only way,” Sterling said. “Yeah, I know.” I looked at the ground. The dust blowing in fine swirls around my boots. I knew what was coming. Sterling shot the cartwright once, in the face, and he crumpled to the ground. No time to even be surprised by it. The mule began to pull the cart, unbidden, as if by habit. The two dogs followed it into the coming night. We looked back toward the river. Murph was gone.

# Physical Violence
### Comes from disrespect
### Comes from shame
### Used to assert power or pride

### Becomes a vicious cycle

They were hidden in alleys, were found in bloating piles in the troughs of the hills outside the cities, the faces puffed and green, allergic now to life.

### Used to “save face” and save pride and may sacrifice body to do so

# Emotional Violence
### Does not give importance or respect to others feelings
>The ghosts of the dead filled the empty seats of every gate I passed: boys destroyed by mortars and rockets and bullets and IEDs to the point that when we tried to get them to a medevac, the skin slid off, or limbs barely held in place detached, and I thought that they were young and had girls at home or some dream that they thought would make their lives important. They had been wrong of course. You don’t dream when you are dead. I dream. The living dream, though I won’t say thanks for that.
### Refusal to listen to
### Denying a person’s feelings
### Telling people how to feel
### Ridiculing
### Controlling behavior
### Asserting Dominance
### Makes people feel powerless or angry
