# Love v Lust
#### In the short story *Keith* Ron Carlson writes a story about the differences between love vs lust, both of witch can be seen in the relationship between Keith and Barbra.

At the beggining of there story it seems like love is manifested in the relationship barbra has with her current boyfriend 

>"He missed all last week. Mr. Miles told me that Keith’s on medication.” “Oh my god!” Trish clamped the steering wheel. “He’s got cancer. That’s the scary hairdo. He’s sick.”
“No he doesn’t. I checked the college lists. He’s going to Dickinson.”
“Not for long, honey. I should have known this.” Trish inhaled and blew smoke thoughtfully out of the side of her mouth. “Bald kids in high school without earrings have got cancer.”"
