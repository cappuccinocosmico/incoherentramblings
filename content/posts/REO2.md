I have still been enjoying the book, I think that it is improving as it goes on, I think that the book is starting to show its true potential as the group grows in size and as the new characters complicate matters within the POV group.

Whats also been realy instresting about this is that the geopolitics has become more intresting as the evil empire (that also happens to employ the protagonists. ) spends most of its resources wasted between fights with the supiriors. And it looks like the story is going to end up with one of the generals (known as the taken, because the big bad is controling them with magig LOTR style). Taking control over the empire and continuing the cycle of exploitation.

So far I would give the book 8/10
