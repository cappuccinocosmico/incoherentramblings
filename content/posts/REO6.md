Dr. James Hansen, formerly Director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, is Adjunct Professor and at Columbia Universityâ€™s Earth Institute,  where he directs a program in Climate Science, Awareness and Solutions.  He was trained in physics and astronomy in the space science program of Dr. James Van Allen at the University of Iowa. His early research on
the clouds of Venus helped identify their composition as sulfuric acid. Since the late 1970s, he has focused his research on
Earth's climate, especially human-made climate change. Dr. Hansen is best known for his testimony on
climate change to congressional committees in the 1980s that helped raise broad awareness of the global warming issue. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1995 and was designated by Time Magazine in 2006 as one of the 100 most influential people on Earth. Dr. Hansen is recognized for speaking truth to power, for identifying ineffectual policies as greenwash, and for outlining actions that the public must take to protect the future of young people and other life on our planet. One of his most important contributions in that regard.
