Hi, My name is Nicholas Venner, I am from the Denver Metro Area. I would like to thank you so much for coming out here to support us and this case.

I am reminded in times like these the true scope of issues that we fight for. We all have those places that we fight to protect, the places that are near and dear to our hearts that we fight for. However climate change is fundamentaly different from other enviormental threats. It isnt just one waterway, or a single forest. Its all forests on earth. The extent of damage by climate change is truley massive, and its impacts spread far beyond what an Individual can experience, both because climate change is a global problem, but also because most of the impacts of climate change are felt far into the future, by the youth of today, and even more so for the generations who have not yet been born, and they will ultimatly pay the price for our actions now.

And thats why we fight even when it seems like all hope has faded. We fight beyond ourselves. We fight so that the youth can live in a world vaugely resembling the one that we live in today. And its an opportunity to make the world a better place for those who come after us. Thats why. Thank you so much for being  *(And its because of that, that we must continue to fight, even in the darkest of hours)

* Take out in case of favorable ruling sunday morning!

Because we fight not for ourselves, and the places we hold dear, and the damages that we have suffered. But for all of the pepole who will come after us, and for the entire global ecosystem. I remember this when things seem hopeless. `For when things seem hopeless is the very time we cant afford to quit.`` -->
