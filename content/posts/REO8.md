This is a quick transcript of a speach that I gave in front of about 300-400 pepole at the rally in eugene oregon.
**Hi, My name is Nicholas Venner, I am here from Colorado and the Denver Metro Area. I would like to thank you so much for coming out here to support this case. I am reminded in times like these the true scope of issues that we fight for. We all have those places that we fight to protect, the places that are near and dear to our hearts that we fight for. However climate change is fundamentaly different from other enviormental threats. It isnt just one waterway, or a single forest. Its all forests on earth. The extent of damage by climate change is truley massive, and its impacts spread far beyond what an Individual can experience, both because climate change is a global problem, but also because most of the impacts of climate change are felt far into the future, by the youth of today, and even more so for the generations who have not yet been born, and they will ultimatly pay the price for our actions now. Climate change is an unusual problem. And we live in unsusual times. It is unusual for the supreme court to stay a case on the eve of trial. It is unusal for the governement to fight a trial this much. But even in the face of such hardship, I hope we can prevail.**

*I tried googling to see if someone had gotten it on tape but apparently not. :(*

<!-- And thats why we fight even when it seems like all hope has faded. We fight beyond ourselves. We fight so that the youth can live in a world vaugely resembling the one that we live in today. And its an opportunity to make the world a better place for those who come after us. Thats why. Thank you so much for being here today. *(And its because of that, that we must continue to fight, even in the darkest of hours)* -->

*Take out in case of favorable ruling sunday morning!*
<!-- And its` for that reason why its essential to fight to fix it. To continue to fight when the problem is at its biggest and most unstoppable.  Because we fight not for ourselves, and the places we hold dear, and the damages that we have suffered. But for all of the pepole who will come after us, and for the entire global ecosystem. I remember this when things seem hopeless. `For when things seem hopeless is the very time we cant afford to quit.`` -->

<!-- Because we are not fighting for just ourselves and the dammages me and my fellow plantiffs have experienced. We are fighting for all the pepole who are going to be hurt most by climate change, future generations. They have -->
