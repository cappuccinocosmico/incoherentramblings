I first started reading this book at the suggestion of a youtube video about the use of magic as a worldbuilding tool. Specificly the use of soft magic as a worldbuilding aid.

So far I would say I am impressed by it, specificly the way its different from other fantasy books that I have read. The way it puts villans in the protagonistic role is refreshing. As it follows a guild of assassins called the "Black Comapany", as they are employed by the forces of evil to snuff out the forces of good. But other then that I am finding it a bit to edgy at times [expecialy with how many words it makes up](https://xkcd.com/483/). It seems to be focusing less on its characters and more on its setting, as the geopolitics are fleshed out more then the main character. But that being said the world is incredibly well thought out with the implications of magic having real world consequences.

But so far I would probably give the book 7/10
