Connie: Neglect

> There was one good thing: June went places with girl friends of hers, girls who were just as plain and steady as she, and so when
Connie wanted to do that her mother had no objections.

> Her parents and sister were going to a barbecue at an aunt's house and Connie said no, she wasn't interested, rolling her
eyes to let her mother know just what she thought of it. "Stay home alone then," her mother said sharply. Connie sat out back in a lawn chair and watched them drive away

Mother: Unaccepting

> Connie had to hear her praised all the time
by her mother and her mother's sisters. June did this, June did that, she saved money and helped clean the house and cooked and
Connie couldn't do a thing, her mind was all filled with trashy daydreams.

Father: Neglect

>Their father was away at work most of the time and when
he came home he wanted supper and he read the newspaper at supper and after supper he went to bed. He didn't bother talking
much to them,
